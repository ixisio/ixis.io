        <h1 class="typography--type-1 color--white">Hillcss Framework v1.0 is Ready</h1>
        <p>A couple of days ago a friend of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/vadimhermann" title="Vadim Hermann" class="typography--no-link">@Vaddo</a> and me launched a CSS Framework called hillcss. It's now available on <a href="https://github.com/teamwrk/hillcss/" title="Hillcss on Github" class="typography--link">Github</a>.</p>

            <p>Starting with the foundation of a frontend project is always about the same repeating things. Creating a Grid for example: Decide how many columns you need and talking with design teams to find a suitable solution for the design layout.</p>
            <p>With hillcss, we start from across. First define the defaults for your project. After that frontend and design teams can start their work but now with the same fundamentals: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Grid and gutter spaces</li>
                <li>Vertical and horizontal spaces</li>
                <li>Breakpoints</li>
                <li>Layers on which elements can be placed (<code>z-index</code> levels)</li>
                <li>Root text size</li>
                <li>Text sizes based on the root size</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hillcss comprises exactly that parts. As we think enough to create a skeleton of a website or application. The next step is to fill this skeleton with live, your modules. Each module can be placed inside a hillcss layout container. We call them boxes. A box can spread differently on the page. Therefore we create a box <a href="https://github.com/teamwrk/hillcss/blob/master/docs/README.md#32---layout-boxes">grid layout based on fractions</a>.</p>

            <p>There is a lot more to say about hillcss, but for now I think it gives you a short overview why we create hillcss and how you could benefit from it when using it for your next upcoming project. Your can read more about the actual feature-set of hillcss on <a href="https://github.com/teamwrk/hillcss/blob/master/docs/README.md#3---use-hillcss">Github</a>.</p>
