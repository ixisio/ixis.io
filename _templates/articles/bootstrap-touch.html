        <h1 class="typography--type-2 color--white">Bootstrap Touch</h1>

        <p>One of <a class="typography--link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap&#39;s</a> largest gabs is, it&#39;s not optimized for touch-enabled devices.
        Yeah I mean, it&#39;s not optimized for these device-types, but it works okay. But sometimes, we as developers have to enlarge the functionality of a BS component. You all know, this is <i>pain-in-the-ass</i>.</p>

            <p>For example, a UX expert wants to close the popover component by clicking on the whole document, instead of clicking on the link target again. You add some lines of code to <code>popover.js</code>, your UX expert is enormously happy, but the update capability of that component is no longer available. That sucks monstrous!</p>

            <p>The next example is the foundation and the idea of a framework, that is build on top of BS, and I called it <strong>Bootstrap-Touch</strong>.</p>

            <h2>The Aim of Bootstrap-Touch</h2>

            <p>BS-Touch do not change the original BS Library sourcecode. It&#39;s a layer for touch interaction and visual improvements, that doesn&#39;t work as a standalone framework.
            The framework has a build-in touch detection and invoke its functionality only on touch or MSPointer enabled devices, like the iPhone or Nokia WindowsPhone.
            It&#39;s not a part of BS, it&#39;s an extension that works hand-in-hand with BS.</p>

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>You have to load two additional files into your existing BS project.</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">bootstrap-touch.js
bootstrap-touch.css</code></pre>

            <p>If the plugin detects a touch-enabled device, it auto-overwrites the default component behavior and styling.
            If you are familiar with <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt.js - the JavaScript Task Runner</a>, you can also use a modified BS build process to integrate/concat BS-Touch directly into your bootstrap files (future Todo).</p>

            <h2>Project State</h2>
            <p>Currently, I work on a technical concept of such a framework. I&#39;m trying to find an answer, on how this could be realized.
            Last Week, I released a early prototype of one BS component for touch-enabled devices. The project sourcecode is available on <a href="https://github.com/ixisio/bootstrap-touch-carousel">Github</a>. See the live <a href="//ixisio.github.io/bootstrap-touch-carousel/">demo</a>.</p>
